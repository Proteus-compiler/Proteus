## Proteus Compiler - V3 

The point of this project was to eliminate some issues that were coming up with V1 and V2 compilers. We chose to write the compiler
in Scala as it runs on the JVM and utilizes Java Byte Code, eliminating the issue of machine dependence. We also
addressed some bugs that appeared in V1 and V2.

across different platforms.
